Project 1 ReadMe

The code implementing the three greedy algorithms is in the folder "GreedyAlgorithms." snowglobe.h contains the definition of the snowglobe struct used in the program, and knapsack.cpp contains the implementations of the greedy algorithms.

The code implementing the exhaustive search is in the folder "Exhaust." snowglobe.h contains the definition of the snowglobe struct used in the program, knapsack.cpp contains a binary array implementation of an exhaustive search, and recursice.cpp contains a recursive implementation of an exhaustive search.

The code implementing the pruned search is in the folder "Pruning." snowglobe.h contains the definition of the snowglobe struct used in the program, and recursive.cpp contains the pruned recursive implementation.

The code implementing the simulated annealing optimization is in the folder "Optimization." snowglobe.h contains the definition of the snowglobe struct used in the program, and knapsack.cpp contains the implementations of the optimization.

When running any of the above programs, enter the name of the file containing the test data when prompted. The code will output the resulting knapsack.
